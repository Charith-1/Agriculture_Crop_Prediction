# Agriculture Crop Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description

This research project focuses on predicting agriculture crop yields using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of crop yield predictions, which is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions. Traditional methods often rely on historical data and subjective assessments, which can be inaccurate. By leveraging machine learning and regression algorithms, this project aims to provide more reliable predictions.
